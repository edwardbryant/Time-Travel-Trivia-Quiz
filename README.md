# Time-Travel-Trivia-Quiz

The original version of this project was completed for Thinkful's Frontend Developer Program. The project demonstrates the use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery as the basis of a simple web-based trivia game. In completing the assignment, I selected a theme focused on trivia concerning time travel in popular media (e.g., movies, television, books). The complete code is provided below for anyone who may find it useful.

#### replaceHeading()

This function is purely cosmetic and is used to reduce the size of the existing pages's header to allow more space for displaying question/answer content.

#### cycleTestimonials(index, prev)

This function is another cosmetic extra which is used to cycle the joke 'testimonials' that appear on the start page. 

#### newGame()

#### pickQuestion()

This function resets game environment vars (e.g., the user's score, question history, etc.).
