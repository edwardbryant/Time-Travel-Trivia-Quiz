# Time-Travel-Trivia-Quiz

The original version of this project was completed for Thinkful's Frontend Developer Program. The project demonstrates the use of HTML, CSS, and jQuery as the basis of a simple web-based trivia game. In completing the assignment, I selected a theme focused on trivia concerning time travel in popular media (e.g., movies, television, books). The complete code is provided below for anyone who may find it useful.
